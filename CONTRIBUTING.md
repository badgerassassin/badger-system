# Contributing to BadgerDAO

This document may serve as a reference to those interested in contributing to the BadgerDAO ecosystem and software.  BadgerDAO accepts contributions from any developer, so long as the submissions meet certain criteria and follow specific guidelines.

## Organization

The surface of the BadgerDAO projects reside in the Badger-Finance organization accessible at [https://github.com/Badger-Finance](https://github.com/Badger-Finance)

Notable projects within the organization are badger-system and badger-projects, the scope of which allows anyone to view or fork.

### badger-system

## Guidelines for Contributing

If you are looking for something to do within Badger to help push the project forward, refer first to the Issues board to see where help is needed.

When writing code, if you are writing the Badger repositories (for core developers), you should maintain your own branch of the project prefixed by the GitHub username, followed by a hyphen, followed by the feature name. Example: `badgerassassin-fix-bug-in-bdigg`.

If you are a contributor that does not have write access to the repo you are interested in contributing to, you should fork the repo in question, and keep your changes in sync with the official Badger remote as you make progress.

All contributions must be made in the form of pull requests, which will then be reviewed. Issue tracking and code submission is done entirely through git, so try to keep the conversation there where it is visible!
